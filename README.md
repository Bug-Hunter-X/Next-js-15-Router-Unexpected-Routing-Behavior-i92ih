# Next.js 15 Router Unexpected Routing Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected routing behavior in Next.js 15 when navigating between pages using the `useRouter` hook.  The navigation does not work as expected. The issue is that after navigating from the home page to the about page, the back button does not return to the previous page.
